                <h1>What is this?</h1>
                <p>Amazon Prime Air is a drone delivery service currently in development by Amazon. Operations were expected to begin in select cities starting late 2019; however, as of November 7, 2020, the service has yet to materialized.</p>
                <p>The service uses delivery drones to autonomously fly individual packages to customers within 30 minutes of ordering. To qualify for 30-minute delivery, the order must be less than 5 pounds (2.25 kg), must be small enough to fit in the cargo box that the craft will carry, and must have a delivery location within a 10-mile (16 km) radius of a participating Amazon order fulfillment center.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Drone Delivery</h2>
        
            <div class="col-3">
            
                <h3>Time Management</h3>
                <p>The human delivery system can face many problems during parcel delivery such as confusing traffic, lazy driver etc. 
                By using the drone, the humans can only focus on the order fulfillment and customer care while the drones deliver the product.</p>

                <h3>Prompt and Safe Delivery</h3>
                <p>There is a problem with drone delivery, for example, you are not at home when the package arrives. There is a chance that someone will tamper with your package or steal it. Because your package is left on your doorstep when nobody is watching it. 
                But there is a solution, with drone delivery you can set the time of delivery when you are at home. The drone will come at this time and will deliver the package. In this way, you do not need to call the courier company for the claim. 
                It is very difficult to get a refund from the company as it has all the record of package delivery. Another benefit is that your package will reach to you in good condition. Because there is not any person who is delivering the parcel. 
                The delivery by personnel can face many dangers while delivering. As the drones are flying in the air and they do not face any kind of traffic so there are fewer chances that your package will get damage.</p>

                <h3>Better for The Environment</h3>
                <p>When your package leaves the warehouse, it spends most of its time on the road. The transport used for delivering this package emits fossil duels that are used for energy. These fossil fuels are dangerous for the environment. 
                On the other hand, drones use a safe source of energy and by ordering via drone delivery you are contributing to saving your atmosphere from greenhouse gasses.</p>

                <h3>What the MK27 Amazon Delivery Drone Can Do</h3>
                <p>The MK27 unmanned aircraft is electric and has a range of 15 miles. It has a “carry weight” of five pounds or 2.3kg. (Over 75 percent of all Amazon delivers are under five pounds.) 
                Its design lets it tilt its rotors forward so it can land and takeoff vertically, but Amazon says it retains an aerodynamic flight profile.</p>
                
                <h3>It Comes with Sensors; Lots of Sensors</h3>
                <p>The drone comes with visual, thermal and sonar cameras. The visual and thermal cameras  work with computer vision algorithms to identify objects or people that are in the drone’s path. 
                If the drone detects a person in the package drop-off zone it will automatically stop its descent. The computer vision software can spot airborne objects and even detect thin clothes lines.</p>
                
                <h3>Air Traffic Management System</h3>
                <p>As part of the inbuilt safety features the drones will be restricted to 400 feet so they won’t encounter airplanes or helicopters. 
                The system will communicate over LTE mobile networks, while Amazon have also stated that it can operate over cloud-based connections.</p>
