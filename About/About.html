        <h3>Hector Carrasco</h3>
        <p>Hi all, I'm Hector! Mucho Gusto! New York City Native, and huge Knicks fan. Mayabe one day, we will be good. Coding is my passion and hobby. So, it made perfect sense to do it for a living. Have to admit, was the best decision of my life. We are commonly asked; "Why did we start this company?". My simple response is, there's nothing I rather do.  </p><br>

        <h3>Rainer Magpali</h3>
        <p>Good Day! Rainer is the name. Orginally from the Philippines. Before coding and owning a compnay, I was actually a nurse. Coding was always a passion. Equally with healthcare. Wanted to combine the two. Therefore, we started a drone shipping company. My wife still asks me why, till this day. At least my kids think it's "lit". Still don't know what half of the words, they say, mean.</p>

        <h3>Rashaan Richardson</h3>
        <p>Rashaan, here! A little bit about me huh... Well to start, I love to travel. Which is half the reason I started coding. What's better than doing career I love, traveling the world, and working on my tan. All at the same time. Have been blessed enough to live all around the world. Must admit; Mexico City is my favorite city. Viva Mexcio! Just like Hector, I am a lifelong Knicks fan. Unlike Hector, My faith has wore out. Lastly, Go Navy! Beat Army!</p>
